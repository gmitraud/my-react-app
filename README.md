# React + Vite

This project was created using 'Vite'.

My name is Gabriel Mitraud and my current aspiration is to become a Front-end Dev Jr. Therefore, I am studying the React Library and its possibilites.

The main goal of this project is to learn and code new functionalities using Javascript and React in order to fully learn and develop my abilities on this language and library, therefore, the project itself will not be towards a specific webpage, such as Crud pages. Instead, I'll be using this project to add new features on React that I need to learn.

As the days goes by, I will be adding new features, styles and functionalities, as well as using GIT as version control.

If you are interested in the project, or to see what's been done already, simply download the .zip archive, access it on your terminal window and execute `npm i` to install the repository dependecies and run `npm run dev`.
The localhost IP should be displayed on your terminal.

Thanks for bearing with me!
